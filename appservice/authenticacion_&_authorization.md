App Service provides built-in authentication and authorization support, so you can sign in users and access data by writing minimal or no code in your web app, API, and mobile back end, and also Azure Functions. This feature can save you time and effort by providing out-of-the-box authentication with federated identity providers, like Azure AD, Facebook, Google or Twitter, allowing you to focus on the rest of your application.

However, you're not required to use App Service for authentication and authorization. Many web frameworks are bundled with security features, and you can use them if you like. If you need more flexibility than App Service provides, you can also write your own utilities.
